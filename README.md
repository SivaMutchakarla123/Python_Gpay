# Python_Gpay
Digital Payment Application
The aim of this project was to simulate basic banking functionalities such as user registration, login, balance inquiry, money transfer, and transaction history in a secure and user-friendly way.

To begin with, I used object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to structure the application. I created classes for users and transactions, with relevant attributes such as username, password, account balance, and transaction details. This approach helped keep the code organized, reusable, and easy to update.

I implemented user authentication by storing login credentials and validating them during sign-in. File handling was used to store and retrieve user data and transaction history, ensuring data persistence even after the program was closed. Lists and dictionaries were used to manage account details and maintain the flow of transactions efficiently.

For the core functionality, I developed features that allowed users to send money, receive money, and view mini statements. Conditional statements ensured that transfers were only successful if the account had sufficient balance. Each transaction was recorded with a timestamp, allowing users to track their payment history.

To enhance usability, I designed a simple text-based interface with clear menus and options. Input validation and error handling were added to prevent crashes and guide the user through correct inputs.

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of Python’s data handling, file operations, and logic building. It also gave me valuable experience in simulating real-time applications that involve security, accuracy, and user interaction. Overall, this project helped me develop both technical and logical thinking skills required for building real-world financial applications.
